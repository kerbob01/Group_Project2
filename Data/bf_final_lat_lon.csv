It had longer arms and a slight sway as it walked. The men on the RR were behind a hedgerow and would not be able to see the animal. It went around the bend in the river and disappeared.

"I'm sorry, but it's been a rather fruitless search online for the bridletrail map. I know they have a pamphlet with the trails but I haven't found it online.

Cross it and you come to a large island, which you go right off of into a small trickle of the creek and onto a rather stony bed. Which you cross another creek to a forested area full of hemlocks. There is (or was, I haven't gotten down there this year) an old tree with a phone set in the middle. If you see that, you're on the trail. You just follow the trail until you come to a fork. In front of you is a straight path, usually mowed, stating no tresspassing. The right is a trail I've never really been on, and the left is the trail to the pines. Naturally you want to go left.

Near Crouch Idaho(Valley County) about 20 or so miles up rd.# 698 is Boiling Springs Campground and a few hundred yards away is a forest service cabin and a creek right next to the campground. On November 1st 2009 around 8:00 p.m. we saw something between the trees between our sight and the rest rooms. It was walking back and forth in the clearing and swaying back and forth in the same spot when it stopped to better see us through the opening in the trees. Nothing occured to us except it maybe have been some one but we were the only campers for miles. The following year in October 30th 2010 around 10:00 p.m. at the same location we were getting spooked by the area for no reason and we actually packed up and left when again there were no other campers and we heard what sounded like a large boulder about 75-100 yards away hit the ground with a great thud. No boulder rolling or crashing down a hill but like it was thrown or dropped out of the air. No smells or sightings except a few possible 11 inch tracks in the dirt a month prior while hunting in that area. The other incident was quite interesting as well.

"The incident happened in the Lassen National Forest on a fire road the runs along side Lost Creek.  I believe this road eventually intersects with route 44 to the west.  We got to the road from the Lost Creek campground, which is located off of the Lassen Park Road, which is a few miles east of Manzanita Lake.  From the campground you walk north about a hundred yards or so to a fence next to the amp theater. On the other side of the fence is a logging road that will eventually bring you to the road in question.",Lassen County,California,Summer,,40.5394389,-120.7120023,Aug-84,1984,4132,Class A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"united states michigan stclair county goodells hwy 21 and rabbidue rd ok well this is to help you out and if im contacted i will get you in touch with the other two individules that wittnessed the incident. this occured in october of 1988 in st.clair county michigan, near mich. hwy 21 and rabidue rd. neer goodells mi. two friends and i wher out in the state forest in october for deer hunting season. we wher camping out on a ridge about 1 mile from the junction of the two roads i mentioned. it was dark, and we wher sitting around our fire talking. we all heard something walking the low side of the ridge along the north side by the pine river about 40-50 yds distant. it was heavy, and methodical in its movement. it didnt really waver and never triped over all the branches brush and undergrowth along the stream. it circled to the east then we heard a piercing screem. we all froze and began to regain our thoughts. we decided it was someone trying to scare us. during this time the creature in question moved to the south slope of the ridge and was no more than 20 yards distant. we had no view of anything as haveing all just rose from the fire we couldnt see to far into the woods. dan yelled out that we all had weapons and the joke was up but if the individule didnt show themselves we would shoot in its direction. the next we heard was a loud high pitched screem and a tree falling. we all retreated to the fireside again and as we did something very large passed us just beyond the fire light and was running faster than us with long strides we could hear the footfalls and it tore through the forest knocking down small sapplings and dead branches as it went. if you know how in the woods at night sound travels, just imagine our surprise when we judged its speed by the length of time it took the sound to fade to nothing. it was no more than 15-20 seconds. after a short time we got our nerve up again, and took flashlights to wher the sound of the tree falling came from. to our surprise we found a tree about 6-8 inches in diameter snapped like a toothpick, about 8 1/2 feet up. we returned to camp and decided to stay by the fire and leave at daybreak for the road, even though only 1/2 mile or slightly more , it was dark we couldnt see too well and whatever it was could see real well. that night as the fire died several times we could make out a large outline shadow about 10-15 yards beyond the good light watching us at one point it aproached a view steps and when we all moved to reach for weapons it retreated into the dark and reapeard off to the side . this went on all night. the next day we left and that night discussed it with dan's father whom informed us something had been watching him while he sat in his tree stand, and he heard strange squeels and hoots in the distance of the valley. a week later we again returned to our camp, this time the thing only circled us, we experienced this throughout the deer season, and once we were able to see something crowched over in a squatting position, watching us as we watched it we could get the outline and tell it had dark black like hair or fur, it used its hands as we do to steady itself, and its eyes glowed yellowish in the light not green or red like so many wild animals do. this continued for about 2-3 months, and then stopped. i havent been out there in several years but if sasquatch wanted a place to live in that area of michigan, beards hills is ideal. it has hills ridges swamps water and many things and places to stay deep enough to not be found this area is forested from yale area all the way to lexington mi. by lake huron. thank you for your time and as i said i can get you in touch with the two other wittnesses if you want them to confirm this we told only close friends for fear of being thought of as a bunch of young liars, we wher only 18,19, and 20 at the time.",St. Clair County,Michigan,Fall,,43.016179,-82.6483442,Fall 1988,1988,822,Class A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
