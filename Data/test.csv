1,"Because of today's report of a Bigfoot Body, my memory was jarred by a story from my now deceased grandfather. In the Fall of 1925 my grandfather and his brother were hunting duck around Horsehoe Lake in Bordelonville, Louisiana. The area was swampy and woodsy, but opened onto farm land and pastures. Paw Paw and my uncle were headed into the duck blinds at sunrise. The weather was cool and the steam was coming off the water. After climbing over a pasture fence with a kerosene lamp, they saw two red, round reflections in the tree line ahead of them. They stopped in their tracks as the ""lights"" came closer to them attracted to the light. Paw Paw said that he and his brother were frozen in fear and couldn't move. I don't know what the french name they used for it, but as it came closer it was a lumbering, furry figure, with red eyes reflecting in the light. When it came within a few feet, my uncle panicked and slapped my grandfather and they dropped everything they had with them and ran like hell all the way back home. That story is our family legend and I always thought they were joking when telling it. Maybe they weren't.",,Avoyelles Parish,Louisiana,Fall,Report 24413: Woman recounts a tale her Grandfather told her about a frightening incident near Horseshoe Lake,31.08774,-91.84467,10/14/1925,1925,24413,Class B,9vw8y52g0n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"This is the second time I have listed this report.  Two men Lawyer Henry and another fellow were quail hunting along a fence line near the Trinity River (A swamp, tall old oak, hickory and pecan.)  They saw a very large 9' tall brown/black creature burst from the very thick brush carrying a calf.  The calf weighed approx 300lbs and this animal had it in its arms running upright.  Needless to say they departed the area and sped back to their employer a MR. JW who would like to remain confedential due to his failing health.  As dusk approached MR JW, Sherrif, and the hunters returned to the location to find; one dead calf, entrails removed and brush busted up all around.  The three dogs MR JW brought would not get out of the car and the concenious opinion was to leave. Not long after this occured MR Lawyer Henry, his family and many neighbors left the area.  A couple of their house still stand, although in severe disrepair and grown up with brush.  The area is still remote and on private land.","Leon County Texas, 1930's along the Trinity river about 120 miles from Houston",Leon County,Texas,Fall,Report 2477: Nine foot tall brown/black creature seen carrying a calf.,31.40444,-95.70861,9/30/1930,1930,2477,Class B,9vefwj505e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"As told to me numerous times by my father (now deceased). When he was a young man of 18, while on a coon hunt, he and three others encountered what I now believe was a bigfoot type of creature. The witnesses were as I said coon hunting , it was at night, and they had set up a camp fire and waited for the coon-dogs to sniff out a coon. After about a half-hour they noticed that the dogs were not barking or carring on (as coon dogs do when they find a coon) in fact, the dogs did not leave the men sides. They were real close by the fire acting very scared. About that time they noticed a huge white haired figure standing about 30 or so yards from the fire. It was just standing there watching them. Now my father who lived and hunted in the area all his life, never encountered such a creature before. As the rest of the men. They did not stand around to see what the creature would do, they got out of there as fast as they could. They told other people what they saw, and of course no one believed them. Actually one man who lived in the bottoms , as what my father called them, said that he heard very strange ""screams"" come from the bottoms, most of the time only at night. This occured around 10:00pm-11:00pm in May of 1938, near the town of Red Oak, Texas. I remember My father telling me that they had to go through heavy brush and cross Red Oak Creek to get to the area where the encounter happened. Red Oak, I think, is south or southeast of Dallas, I would guess about 25-30 miles out of Dallas. There were four witnesses -- my father and some friends. I know that this sighting that I am telling you happened a long time ago, but I thought I would tell you about it anyway. My father was a very honest man who was also a bible thumper, and I know his story to be true. I was interested in this subject of bigfoot for a long time. My father told his story to me alot of times. I remember reading about a white bigfoot in the Lake Worth area back in 1968-69, and it sounds like the same creature my father saw. I don't know if it was seen again since then. Maybe you can fill me in on this, if you have anything. I do have another story about my fathers brother who went back up there to see if he and some friends would encounter the creature, and they did have an encounter with it. If you want that story you can let me know and I will tell you it. I know you people work out of the northwest, but I thought you might like to know, there are some(or were) of these creatures in northeast Texas.",,Ellis County,Texas,Unknown,Report 2395: Sighting at night by a group of coon hunters; Screams were also heard in the area,32.5175,-96.80417,6/30/1938,1938,2395,Class B,9vg0vptk5m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"My mother related the story to me in 1969.  I remember it clearly. ""Your father and I had gone to Mt. Adams to picknick and enjoy his new Ford. We had driven some miles up into the hills when we found a partial clearing where we could park and enjoy ourselves. This was when we were engaged in 1941 and were just graduated from Grandview High School in Grandview, Washington. We stayed for part of the day at that spot. In the afternoon we had decided to leave. We had packed up and loaded the Ford with our stuff and were turning out of the clearing to go back to Grandview. As we were leaving I turned to see if we had left anything behind us and noticed something black moving in the clearing next to where we had parked. What I saw was a tall black creature covered with hair and very muscular walking quickly across the clearing parallel to us towards the forest. I said to your father, 'Look, whats that,' and pointed behind him at the creature. He slowed the car back down and looking where I pointed he said he didn't see anything. By the time he had slowed the car and looked the creature had dissapeared into the forest. I was the only one that saw it. When I told him what I had seen he said it was only a bear looking for berries to eat probably. I didn't want to argue with him as we were close to getting married and I didn't want to ruin a great outing and throw cold water on what had been a beautiful trip.","It happened in the foothills of Mt. Adams at the Western end of the Yakima valley.  I don't know what the county was but I'm sure it was west of the city of Yakima, Washington on the East side of the mountain.

They had just gone through a shelter belt of trees into a clearing when they heard rustling like something moving in the trees.

1,"The age here is 75 but I remember my first encounter vary well. It was in the summer of 1944, I was 9yrs old. It occurred in Alger co. Mich. near a post office called Eben Jct. It was at my grandfathers farm which was on the edge of The Hiawatha Natl.Forrest. My mother and Aunt were pulling Rhubarb from a patch next to the woods. My male cousin and I ran off in the woods to play a favorite game-This is the kicker--We would take small dead second growth trees and whack them against live bigger trees trying to hit each other with pieces that flew off. After doing this for some time we stopped and looked around for some reason.The opposite side of the wood lot was not vary far away and the sun was bright. What we saw was a huge man standing broad side to us looking at us. He was huge and as we looked he turned and walked away. We flew out of the woods and told our mothers but they just said it was the neighbor man. Well it was not a man. We never went into that section of woods again.

1,"This incident happened around 1947/48.  I was about 12/13 years of age.  I have held this incident in my mind's eye all these years and have tried to figure out what I had seen.  After reading sightings and descriptions on your website, I beleive what I saw could well have been a sasquatch. It was summer time and I was riding my horse, Jenny.  We were going to visit a neighbor.  I was on my regular path through the woods when I saw a lone, large, dark figure.  At first I thought it was a man making ""cat faces"" on the pine trees.  There were a lot of trees in that area  that were being used to collect resin.  It looked as if the man had on a raincoat.  That seemed very strange to me as it was a clear and hot day.  And then when I looked closer, it looked like a fur coat and that really made no sense because it was summer and very warm.  The ""person"" was a distance from me and I hesitate to even try and say how far.  As I was scrutinizing this ""person"", Jenny suddenly stopped and threw her ears forward and raised her head.  She, too, had seen the ""man"".  I urged her to go forward by kicking her in her sides, but she refused to move.  I decided to turn her around and go another direction in order to make her think we were not interested in the ""man"".  She gladly went in the oposite direction.  When I saw she would go in another direction, I turned her around and again proceeded toward the ""man"".  Because Jenny sensed a danger, I was uneasy at this point.  She continued to carry me in the direction of the furry man until we approached to spot she had stopped at before.  She again pointed her ears forward, raised her head, smelled the air and refused to move another step. I watched the creature for awhile as I felt I was at a safe distance.  It was at a large pine tree.  It was making up and down motions (like it could have been scratching its back).  The arms seemed to be raised in the air as it made these undulating motions.  I sat there on Jenny trying to figure out if the creature had on a fur coat or a rain coat and if so, what for?  As I mentioned, I have pondered this for years and it finally makes sense to me in the context of a sasquatch sighting. This took place in Putnam County about 5 miles northe of US 17 in the deep pine forest near my home.  Rice Creek is about 1 mile further north on US 17.  The nearest town is Palatka, Florida - about 5 miles. My mother used to tell me of hearing screams like a woman screaming.  Of course, that could have been a panther.

1,"Something was pounding on something like a log. That brought one of my brothers into the house to alert the rest of the family to ""Come hear this."" We went outside & stood in the driveway, and heard the most frightening guttural roar you can imagine! This accompanied the pounding on the wood object. This lasted several minutes. The evening was clear, warm, without wind. I do not remember a moon. Neither brother could explain what was happening and I recall being scared out of my wits! When the sounds subsided, the family returned inside. The incident was not discussed in front me again. As a child, I was privledged to live in this remote beautiful area and allowed to run free. Sometime later, a boy friend & I observed what we were told must have been a bear in a thicket of alder trees near the house. The feces found there later contained crawdad shells and berry seeds, with a horrible odor, but the creature we saw was not a bear. The hard dry ground showed no tracks. Our fathers were loggers and we were well versed in the local wild life. While this all happened a very long time ago, I still get cold chills remembering those sounds. Years later, my fiance & I were driving North on Oregon's Hwy 101 near Cape Perpetua North of Florence, OR. The highway is narrow, two lane, with Pacific Ocean on the West & steep rock cliffs on the East. I was watching the moon over the ocean, turned sidewise, facing the ocean. A very large black creature rose from a cleft in the cliff and towered over the little car we were in. My fiance yelled ""What the hell was that?"" I only caught a glimpse of the thing through my peripheral vision, but it was huge and very fast. I suppose we surprised it as much as it surprised us. It terrified me. My fiance searched for a place to turn around as he wanted to go back, and I refused to let him. We were armed with what suddenly seemed to be a very small weapon, considering the size of the creature! When we returned home, my fiance told his father about the encounter. His father told us of the rancher at the foot of the Capes (Also on Hwy 101) who had been riding to check on his cattle when he heard a cow bellowing in agony. His horse became nervous but he forced it on and found a very large  hairy animal chewing on the live cow. He carried a 30.06 rifle and shot the creature. It stood up and ran off on two legs. He followed until he lost the trail of blood in the rocky terrain. This is the first time I have ever heard of someone shooting and wounding one of these creatures. It is also the first time I've heard of this creature eating meat of any kind. Our encounter was in the late evening with clear skies and a full moon. My fiance saw the creature in the headlights and had a great view of it. He knew it was not a bear, and didn't think it was human in a fur suit. Facial features did not have a snout and the arms were too long for a bear's front legs. I was too terrified to grasp any features. I have never felt fear like that before or since. The rancher's encounter was in broad daylight, clear skies, rocky terrain, no trees.","About 20 miles from Coquille,near and above the North Fork of the Coquille River.

1,"When I was a child, I heard my grandfather, a man who quit school at sixteen, tell stories about something that lived in the Burns Rebrake (a swampy area owned by a Mr. Homer Burns). The stories he told went back as far as WWI and included among others, my grandfather and my father. They never got a good look at the thing(my father always attributed it to bootleggers)but my grandfather said whatever it was, it drove lumbermen out of the woods and beat panther hounds so bad that they didn't come home for days. When I was little, I listened to the old people describe the thing and it didn't register in my mind until I got older that it sounded an awful lot like a sasquatch. I've heard there's something in Lousiana, and with all the primitive waterways that cross that two states, I wouldn't be surprised if the two aren't connected. The Burns Booger as they called it has been absent from the area since the sixties when the lumber companies went high tech. This is the same time the last panther was heard in Attala County. My great grandfather and a man were logging in the area after WWI and something frightened them so bad that they quit logging and refused to go back in there. My grandfather and father along with some coon hunters saw something standing by a dieing fire that they had built. They said it looked like a man but then it didn't. (My memory is hazy) on the exact descriptions. My father's coon hounds were known to hunt panther, but something tangled into them one night setting the dogs to howling in pain and terror. Before my father or grandfather could get to them, it was over. The dogs didn't come up for days.

1,"When I saw this creature, I was told not to tell anybody or they would think I was crazy!! In 1950 when I was 12 years old,  I lived in a little hamlet called Beauty located in eastern Kentucky, located along the border of the Tug River. We children played in the mountains almost all summer long.  We had heard of a rock cliff back up on the hill that had a cave in it and we decided to go looking for this cliff with the cave.   Being kids, we didn't keep track of how far we climbed or what ridges we went on, but finally we reached this cliff.  We were standing at the base looking up through the shadows of the trees when I noticed there was someone standing up on the rock (about 10 feet up)  looking back at us. He was, I judge about 6 feet tall.   Muscular.  His arms were longer than a humans.His legs about like a human. He had hair much like a chimps hair grows on its arms and legs. NOT the fuzzy hair like a bear.  His chest seemed to be pretty hairless.   Very hairy around the genital area so one could not tell if he was male or female....but I didn't see any breasts so I judged it to be male.    He was holding a heavy stick in his hand as he stood there looking down at us.   I could not see his facial features.    I would say that he was an intelligent being from the way he behaved. He stood looking at us for about 15 seconds then he stepped back out of our sight and was gone.   It was not until I was an adult that I realized what I had seen. I believe this being knew we were children....I believe he allowed us to see him because we did not present him any danger.   Of course we yelled and tore up the bushes running back off that hill!!   I told my grandma that we had seen a gorilla and she told me people would think I was crazy.   So I kept it to myself what I had seen.",Far back in the mountains in eastern Kentucky.
